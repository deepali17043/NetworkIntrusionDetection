# Output from the large Dataset
The directories in this folder are generated by running ```python-scripts``` on the large dataset on Google Cloud Platform.  
```driver_outputs``` are the statements the driver prints as the job executes.  
[project_driver_output.log](https://github.com/deepali17043/NetworkIntrusionDetection/blob/main/outputs/output_large_dataset/driver_outputs/project_driver_output.log) is the output from the job that runs [project.py](https://github.com/deepali17043/NetworkIntrusionDetection/blob/main/python-scripts/project.py).  
[evaluation_driver_output.log](https://github.com/deepali17043/NetworkIntrusionDetection/blob/main/outputs/output_large_dataset/driver_outputs/evaluation_driver_output.log) is the output from the job that runs [project_evaluating_models.py](https://github.com/deepali17043/NetworkIntrusionDetection/blob/main/python-scripts/project_evaluating_models.py).
