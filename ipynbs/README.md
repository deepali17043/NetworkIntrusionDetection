# Python Notebooks

Use these Python notebooks to run the code on your local machine. The output in these notebooks is for the [small dataset](https://github.com/deepali17043/NetworkIntrusionDetection/blob/main/datasets/small_NF_UQ_NIDS_v2.csv.zip).  
File descriptions:  
1. [Project.ipynb](https://github.com/deepali17043/NetworkIntrusionDetection/blob/main/ipynbs/Project.ipynb): The file containing the main driver code. This consists of data reading, preprocessing, priliminary analysis, and Classification.
2. [generate_small_data.ipynb](https://github.com/deepali17043/NetworkIntrusionDetection/blob/main/ipynbs/generate_small_data.ipynb): This is to generate a sample of the dataset.
3. [project_evaluating_models.ipynb](https://github.com/deepali17043/NetworkIntrusionDetection/blob/main/ipynbs/project_evaluating_models.ipynb): This uses a saved model to evaluate the best stoired model and list the feature importance values.
